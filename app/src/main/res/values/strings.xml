    <string name="challenge_rules">Challenges last 21 days or 4 streaks. Streaks
                                   get longer with progress.
                                   \n\nThe 1 streak is 1 day, the second is 3 days,
                                   the third is 7 and the fourth streak is 10 days
                                   long. You have the possibility to skip every
                                   first day of any streak starting from the
                                   second one.
                                   \n\nChallenges start by checking off the first day
                                   after their creation. Unchecked challenges
                                   are considered failed and get deleted
                                   automatically, unless you are at the end of a
                                   streak.
                                   \n\nYou win the challenge by completing all 4 streaks.</string>

    <string name="about_large_text">Fact: Success is something of which we all want more.
        \n\nFact: Most people believe that success is difficult.
        \n\nFact: They’re wrong – it’s not!
        \n\nSuccess isn’t really that difficult. There is a significant portion of the
            population here in North America, that actually want and need success to be hard!
            Why? So they then have a built-in excuse when things don’t go their way!
            Pretty sad situation, to say the least.
        \n\nFor those of you who are serious about having more, doing more, giving more and
            being more, success is achievable with some understanding of what to do, some
            discipline around planning and execution of those plans and belief that you can
            achieve your desires.
        \n\nThe Truth About Success
        \n\nThe first thing to remember about success is that it is a process – nothing more,
            nothing less. There is really no magic to it and it’s not reserved only for a select
            few people. As such, success really has nothing to do with luck, coincidence or fate.
            It really comes down to understanding the steps in the process and then executing
            on those steps.
        \n\nThere are basically six key areas to higher achievement. Some people will tell you
            there are four while others may tell you there are eight. One thing for certain though,
            is that irrespective of the number of steps the experts talk about, they all originate
            from the same roots.
        \n\nFrom my perspective then, here are the six key steps:
        \n\n1. Making the decision
        \n\n2. Clarity – developing the Vision
        \n\n3. Focus – having a plan
        \n\n4. Commitment – understanding the price and having the willingness to pay that price
        \n\n5. Belief – believing in yourself and those around you
        \n\n6. Taking action – practice Ready, Fire, Aim…
        \n\nMaking the Decision
        \n\nIf success is a process with a number of defined steps, then it is just like any other
            process. So, what is the first step in any process?
        \n\nMaking a decision to do something – this is the first step. We all know that nothing
            moves until someone makes a decision. The first action is always in making the decision
            to proceed. This is a fundamental step, which most people overlook.
        \n\nSo, make the decision to move forward. Commit your decision to paper,
            just to bring it into focus. Then, go for it!
        \n\nClarity
        \n\nHaving clarity of purpose and a clear picture of what you desire, is probably the
            single most important factor in achievement. Why is Clarity so important?
        \n\nWithout clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the Universe. We know that
            the Law of Attraction says that we will attract what we focus on, so if we don’t
            have clarity, we will attract confusion.
        \n\nConsider the following analogy:
        \n\nYou are going on a cruise, but when the ship sets sail, you discover it has no rudder.
            What happens? One of 3 things will occur:
        \n\n1. You will sail along until you collide with an immovable object,
            after which you will sink to the bottom
        \n\n2. You will run aground and become hopelessly stuck in the mud
        \n\n3. You will drift aimlessly until you arrive back at the original dock
        \n\nTrying to go through life without clarity is similar to sailing a rudder-less
            ship – no good thing can or will happen!
        \n\nThe sad thing is the majority of people have no clue about what they truly want.
            They have no clarity. When asked the question, responses will be superficial at best,
            and at worst, will be what someone else wants for them.
        \n\nSo how do we get clarity? Simply by asking ourselves lots of questions: What do I really
            want? What does success look like to me? Why do I want a particular thing? How will this
            achievement change my life? How can I use this success to make a difference for others?
        \n\nIntrospection is the trick. Understand what you want, why you want it and what it will
            do for you. This is a critical factor, and as such, is probably the most difficult step.
            For this reason, most people never complete this aspect – then wonder why life is so
            difficult!
        \n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of what you want, it is critical that you
            engage in goal setting – specifically setting SMART goals.
        \n\nSMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time
            Sensitive – S-M-A-R-T. Knowing what you want and setting SMART goals as mileposts on
            your quest cannot help but give you clarity!
        \n\nFocus
        \n\nFocus is having the unwavering attention to complete what you set out to do. There are
            a million distractions in every facet of our lives. Telephones and e-mail, clients and
            managers, spouses and kids, TV, newspapers and radio – the distractions are everywhere
            and endless. Everyone wants a piece of us and the result can be totally overwhelming.
        \n\nSo, how can we stay on course with all the distractions in our lives? Willpower is a
        good start, but it’s very difficult to stay on track simply through willpower.
        \n\nThe best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your goals in mind and then
            work backwards to develop the plan. What steps are required to get you to the goals?
            Make the plan as detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every
            possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep it with you at all times.
            Review it regularly and ensure that every step takes you closer to your Vision and
            Goals. If the plan doesn’t support the vision then change it!
        \n\nAlong with your plans, you should consider developing an action orientation that will
            keep you motivated to move forward at all times. This requires a little self-discipline,
            but is a crucial component to achievement of any kind. Before starting any new activity,
            ask yourself if that activity will move you closer to your goals. If the answer is no,
            you may want to reconsider doing it at that time.
        \n\nI coach my clients to practice the 3 D’s – Defer, Delegate or Delete. Can the particular
            activity be done later? Defer it! Can it be done by someone else? Delegate it! Does it
            need to be done at all? If not, consider deleting it! Posing these questions will help
            to keep you focused on what is truly important!
        \n\nCommitment
        \n\nCommitment is something that comes from understanding that everything has its price and
            then having the willingness to pay that price. This is important because nobody wants
            to put significant effort into something, only to find out after the fact that the price
            was too high.
        \n\nThe price is something not necessarily defined as financial. It could be time, effort,
            sacrifice, money or perhaps, something else. The point is that we must be fully aware
            of the price and be willing to pay it, if we want to have success.
        \n\nBelief
        \n\nThis is perhaps the single biggest obstacle that all of us must overcome
            in order to be successful.
        \n\nWe all carry a lot of baggage, thanks to our upbringing. The majority of people carry
            with them, an entire series of self-limiting beliefs that will absolutely stop, and
            hold them back from, success. Things like “I’m not good enough”, “I’m not smart
            enough”, “I’m not lucky enough”, and the worst, “I’m not worthy” are but a few of the
            self-limiting beliefs I have encountered. We carry them with us like rocks in a
            knapsack, and then use them to sabotage our success. So, how twisted is that?!?!
        \n\nThe old expression is absolutely true – whether you think you can or
            you can’t, you’re right!
        \n\nOne of the main areas that I work on with my clients is shedding these non-supportive
            beliefs and replacing them with beliefs that will help them to accomplish their desires.
        \n\nIt is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our children. So
            why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it intentionally or with malice.
            In the majority of cases, the cause is a well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking
            parent, who says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple
            as that!
        \n\nAnd it’s not just parents that are the cause – teachers, friends, clergy members or
            anyone else that has influence in a child’s life can be a contributor to these
            self-limiting beliefs!
        \n\nThe bottom line is that we must shed the bad and replace with good beliefs.
        \n\nTaking Action
        \n\n“Nothing changes until something moves” – this is the battle cry of author and
            journalist Robert Ringer. And he is absolutely correct. Not all of the decision-making,
            clarity, planning, focus and belief in the world, will get you to where you want to be,
            without taking action!
        \n\nAction – putting your plans into play – that is what will get you to the destination.
            Don’t get caught in the paralysis of analysis, or in the conundrum of Ready,
            Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim…
        \n\nGet the oars in the water and start rowing. Execution is the single biggest factor in
            achievement, so the faster and better your execution, the quicker you will get to
            the goals!
        \n\nConclusion
        \n\nSo, there you have it; the six steps that will help you to the fabled land of
            achievement and success! You now have the opportunity to push ahead and reach your
            potential. No more excuses – make the commitment to take action TODAY!
        \n\nFigure out what you want, put a plan together to achieve it, understand the cost,
            believe in yourself then go and get it!</string>
